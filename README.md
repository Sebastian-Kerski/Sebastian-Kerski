## Hi, I'm Sebastian

I'm an iOS developer focused on building calm, purposeful tools.
I care about product thinking, mental clarity, and software that respects real-world constraints.

Currently, my main focus is **PoisePrep**, a mental preparation app designed for competitive athletes.

A mental readiness tool for competition situations, built from personal experience as a competitive judo athlete.
